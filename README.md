# Facial Emotion Detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascading Model

## Overview

This project utilizes OpenCV and the Haar cascading model to detect facial expressions in real-time. By analyzing facial features, the system accurately identifies and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. This README provides instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Features

- Real-time facial emotion detection
- Support for multiple emotions
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Lightweight and efficient implementation using OpenCV

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Haar cascading model

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/facial-emotion-detection.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the Haar cascading model for facial detection and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd facial-emotion-detection
    ```

2. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The application will open a webcam window displaying real-time facial emotion detection.
